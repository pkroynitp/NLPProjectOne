Dear Boetie, there are 18 areas in which you can purchase property as a non Qatari.  The best known of which are the areas stated previously, The Pearl and West Bay Lagoon (inc. Zig Zag Towers). Also there is Lusail, a whole new city which is presently being built next to the West Bay area, and where the first apts in 'Foxhills' will be available to move into from mid 2013. These will be made up of low rise apartment buildings built around Italian style Piazzas.   Additionally there are 14 other areas, within central Doha, in which you can purchase residential property or land, however these are mainly in the older and far more built up areas of Doha.  If you require more information on available properties or land, then please take a look at our website:  www.mirageproperty.com  where you will find a good selection of properties available for purchase. If there is anything of interest or you require further info, please feel free to contact us directly, via the 'Enquiry' button on the website. One of my sales consultants will then respond and try to assist in any way they can.  I look forward us being of assistance.  Kind regards  Craig at Mirage
