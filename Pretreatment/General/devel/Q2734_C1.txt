ya i agree with ya i agree with u...Dr.khudsia maybe good or smethin but the receptionist out there is hopeless...she behaves as though she is d owner there...i had d misfortune of going there on my friends advises...but the lady in d counter got d nerve out of me with her arrogant behaviour!!as if she ig giving me free social service...!!!!nyways WOMens hospital is d best!get all ur antenatal check ups there...if at all u need to go to private...Dr.Jyothi of FUTURE MEDICAL CENTRE...is good though they r a bit costly but worth than facing dat female in khudsia's clinic!!
