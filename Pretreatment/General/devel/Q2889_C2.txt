Did you guys managed to find any? Hi guys,  Rizks, thanks for the clues. I have been following the past responses but I don't find any in FFC at all.  Alpha 1, I hope you are right, as I will go through thick and thin to find it.  By the way Amoud, did you managed to revive any of your Kefir grains? Would you mind sparing me some if I can't find any here?  Many thanks...  Regards, NKL
