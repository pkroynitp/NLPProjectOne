Moreover A Ph.D. civil engineer is expected to have the same starting salary as a B.Sc. holder!! Never to mention the expectation of the field work; is he supposed to be a site Engineer for example? Isn't he supposed to be working in the research field? With this starting salary for a Ph.D. Emg. in Germany, I'd recommend you'd better apply to a job in Egypt.
