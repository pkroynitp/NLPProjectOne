most schools would tell you most schools would tell you what type of accomodation they provide at least - for example single/one bedroom fully furnished flat.  Also, if they are an ongoing operation, they probably already have the flats rented and should be able to provide more particulars (i.e. photos).    As for getting paid, no matter the status of your residency, they should be paying you while it goes through the bureaucracy, reputable employers do that.  If for some reason you don't get an RP then they should also tell you what happens at that stage (repatriation at the school's expense).
