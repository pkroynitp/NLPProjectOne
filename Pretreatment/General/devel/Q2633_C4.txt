RE: Good Bank If you have time and you're a patient  person, please go for HSBC. It takes in average 30 minutes to reach someone when you call the customer service! And if you call after 5 PM, after waiting 30 minutes they will ask you to call the day after.  Another one from HSBC, if you travel abroad, they may eventually block your credit card (for security reason) and will inform you only when you are back in Qatar. I was left in Thailand without being able to use my credit card and didnt had a single $ to buy food! Thanks to HSBC.  I moved to Commercial Bank (CBQ) and I'm very happy :-)
