RE: Lost baggage This week heathrow has had some baggage system problems due no fault of qatar airways. If you have reported to QR on arrival here they will chase for 5 days then the search will fall to a central desk for matches based on your description. Contact them t ask hw match is going. Good luck - heathrow is very tempremental !!
