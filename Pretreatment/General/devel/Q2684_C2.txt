RE: Checking the history of the Car We had just bought a pre-owned car. We were looking for cars and if we finalised we had got it checked at German Auto Specialist Center on Salwa Road. From there we had found out that many of the cars had minor accidents and had touch up done to them. German Auto Specialist Center also do a full techinal computer checkup of the engine and check the condition of the engine, cylinders, car stability,etc.   Their Ph # is 468 7377. They are open during Ramadan after 7p.m.
