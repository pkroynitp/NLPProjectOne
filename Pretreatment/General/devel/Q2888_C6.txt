RE: Where to buy LAMPE BERGER oil in Doha? Thank you all (pearl, rizar,oltrego,allspice,charline) for the help :)   @Oltrego: If you happen to come home with that and wanted to sell them, I would like to purchase from you thou. kindly private message me on your return please..I need the Eucalyptus and Lavender or Ocean 1L. thanking you in advance.   @Elegance: Well, you can use them to fry burgers. an every expensive one! Its some sort of air purification oil that helps fragrnace the air and it also claims can kill airborne bacteria. I have 19 months old and found this oil is very good if she has flu or simply set up a very nice atmosphere before she sleeps at night.  @Allspice: Thank youuuu .... will go to Point ala Ligne Royal Plaza today. btw, are they in Alsaad (next to the sushi thingy? only been here 2 months now)
