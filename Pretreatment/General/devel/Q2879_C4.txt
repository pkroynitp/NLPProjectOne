Assaha Restaurant I had dinner there a couple of years back, and as a Lebanese i was not very satisfied with the food. The "ambiance" is nice but that's it. Moreover, it is expensive for what u're eating! Al Khreiss in Souq Wakif is much better and prices are more accessible to all. Le Gourmet also is not bad.  I heard that Damaska is not bad (also in Souq). You also have Al Mourjan Restaurant on the Corniche. We were there last friday and they have a minimum fee of 150 QRS per person. But the food is excellent. Until now, this restaurant is the closest to Lebanese food possible. As for the seafood restaurant in Katara, i heard it's very tasty but i think it's expensive. Also there's the Bourj Al Hamam in  the Pearl which should be way too expensive. Bon Appetit :)
