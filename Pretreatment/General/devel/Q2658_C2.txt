Koala Nursery Hi there. You can check out Koala Nursery. ITs Lebanese/French/English and they are a new nursery and its a really great place.  Here's the link     http://www.koalanursery.com.qa/home/index.php?lang=en  WE have been really happy with them.  And for summer they did a summer camp during Ramadan for 2 months.  We paid approx 2300 QAR and it included snacks for them. Our daughter really enjoyed it.
