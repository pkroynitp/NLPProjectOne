RE: I want to stop smoking Best way to get rid of smoking habbit is gradually decrease the number. think of times when you just smoke for the heck of it, such as with cup of tea, as soon as you sit in the car etc and then avoid lighting up one at such times. chew a gum or carry a can of juice with you while in the car or outdoor. Dont deprive yourself by just deciding to quit, it will not work. all the best
