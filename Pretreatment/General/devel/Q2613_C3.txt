Pumpkins and Goolies This is an entirely stupid American tradition thought up by some Dickhead President of Pumpkin land who didnt know what to do with his excess of Pumpkins in his land of plenty. He sent most of his Pumpkins to Iraq and Afghanistan I heard. Bollards - stupid question for a moronic tradition!
