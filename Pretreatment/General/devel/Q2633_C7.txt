RE: Good Bank I just closed my account with HSBC yesterday. They're bunch of theives and liars. Any transaction you want to make will cost you minimum of 50QR. I DONOT recommend HSBC at all. I joined Al AHLI Bank and Im very happy with their services. At least when you call someone will pickup the phone.
