RE: Living Expenses and Drinking Water in Qatar Qatar is indeed one of the fastest developing countries in the world. We are not living a primitive life here. However drinking Fuel is far cheaper than Mineral Water. Jokes apart, You get all kind of Mineral Water in Qatar and that too from all parts of the world. I am sure there is a brand of mineral water of Jordan as well, coz i have seen and bought Lebanese brand as well. The water is really tasty.  Anyway the Tap water is very safe to drink in qatar, as long as you filter it. Water is being treated with best and latest technology here. So you need not worry.  In any case you have great quality mineral water here for you to enjoy and drink ! Cheers
