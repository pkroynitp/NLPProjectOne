RE: Vista wirless To connect notebook or desktop having Vista OS though wireless with Mosic you have to give static IP address.  IP Address: 192.168.1.201 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway: 192.168.1.254  Preferred DNS: 212.77.192.59 Alternate DNS: 212.77.192.60  Mozaic only works fast with vista operating system having IP 200 or above. You can verify that from QTEL staff also. I was having same problem and then QTEL staff told to use IP above 200.
