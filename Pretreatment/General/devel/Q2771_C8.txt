as jackmohan said what kind as jackmohan said what kind of wedding is it? usually arabic weddings are shot by female photographers who are not very professional..as camera is not allowed inside the wedding halls they have a seperate section for photoshoot and the shots are mostly potraits done with a single backdrop. if you put down some details.. i can direct you to some of them.  Aana free, jaana free, Pakde gaye tho khana free.
