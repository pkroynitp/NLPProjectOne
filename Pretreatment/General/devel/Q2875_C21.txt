Yes BM.. losing your passport Yes BM.. losing your passport is a nightmare..my friend had to go back to India and wait for three weeks to get his new Passport and visa done to come back here. Thats why I am worried.  As Khanan said..I was also thinking of depositing it at the Hotel reception.   Even if they pickpocket our money, cards ...we can somehow get back here...but without passport we will be stranded there.
