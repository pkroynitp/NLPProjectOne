RE: Where can i drink cheap rate alcohol in Doha? If you drink in bar or pub they put a stamped  in the hand. but have to be careful while driving go with a friend so anyone of u is more drunk the other can drive u safely  U can go to the distellary in Abbuhamor to buy drinks but for that u need a license.  drinking in open is banned here.
