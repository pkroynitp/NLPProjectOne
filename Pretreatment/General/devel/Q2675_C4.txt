There are no Baptist churches There are no Baptist churches as such in Doha.  Only a handful of Christian communities are allowed to have recognized, sponsored, full-time clergy, and the Baptists are not one of them.  The Emir graciously granted land to the Anglican church to lead the various independent Protestant Christian communities in Doha to contract a Protestant center.  Most Baptists and evangelical Christians I know tend to go to the non-denominational Christian communities such as Doha Fellowship and Grace Fellowship.  Both have webpages.  Like the Anglican church (and much of Qatar for the that matter) services are conducted in English, but a fair number of participants do not speak English as their first language.  Hope you find what you are looking for.
