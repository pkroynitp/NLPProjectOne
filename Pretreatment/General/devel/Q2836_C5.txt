RE: Notarization of Documents from Philippines? by the way rey,  if you mean "Authentication" or "Rid Ribbon", you must first send back your documents to your country -Philippines and ask your relatives to stand as your representative to process the authentication in DFA Manila...  there is a reminder flashes in TFC from Phil. Embassy Doha that any documents you want them stamp it or authenticate it..you must first get authenticated it from the philippines (DFA Manila)...  good luck...
