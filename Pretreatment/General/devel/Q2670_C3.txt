RE: Dual Sim Mobile Phone Thats easy to answer. Its YES!!...Samsung is selling a model that has Dual Sim Capability (dont know th exact model,and I saw it in THE MALL) so it means theres no problem using a Dual Sim Phone. Technically. you have two numbers in one phone.as opposed to having two phones for 1st for ur roaming and 2nd for your Qtel/Vodafone number.
