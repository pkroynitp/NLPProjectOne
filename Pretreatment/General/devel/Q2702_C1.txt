RE: Which Indian school is better for  the kids? I definitely recommend PEARL SCHOOL, Indian School in Al Thumama area which is near Old Airport. Very good teachers and Principal. Our family friends have their daughter studying there and they are extremely happy with the progress and development of the child. Very neat and good class rooms with interesting teaching methods. Our son, we are planning to admit him there next academic year as soon as he is of schooling age. I believe their website is www.pearlschool.sch.qa and phone number is 44442555
