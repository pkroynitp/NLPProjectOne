do not carry it around with do not carry it around with you and do not leave it in a suitcase in your room.  Put it in the hotel room safe . If there is none, put in a safety deposit box that the hotel provides. Make sure YOU put it inside, and you get a form from the hotel that indicates that it is their locker and that your passport is in there. With that, THEY have to take responsibility if something untoward happens and can't blame you.
