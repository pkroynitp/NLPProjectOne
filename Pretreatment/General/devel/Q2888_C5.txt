RE: Where to buy LAMPE BERGER oil in Doha? my friend bought his through amazon or was it ebay... way more cheaper he told me, but u have to go and pick it up at customs dept ur self. cos my friend got stuck due to it says on the LB label the % of alcohol... they thought it was alcohol drinks or something...  he explain to them it's a perfume, then after a while the custom dept allow him to take it...  a bit tedious job i would say... but worth all the penny...
