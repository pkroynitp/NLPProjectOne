RE: Certificate Attestation in Doha. If this is to do with her Labour Card then welcome to Labour Card Nightmare!.  I am assuming you are Indian. In this case all her academic certificates (not diplomas from pvt institutions) must be sent to India for attestation from the Foreign Affairs Ministry there. Once it is back attest at Indian Embassy. Then go to MOFA and attest all over again.  And all this should be done on the ORIGINAL Certifiacte and NOT copies.  You can contact Asia Translation or UROGULF and they will charge Qrs. 500 per certificate. You will get it from India in 15 days,.
