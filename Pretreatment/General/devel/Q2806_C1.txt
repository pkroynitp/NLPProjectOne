RE: can somebody tell me,, how can i bring my family in... Your contract should tell that your status should be family, and not bachelor, so that your family will be taken here to Qatar, with all expenses paid by the company.  Several companies are doing like that here in Qatar.  Of course, it will be better for your to be family status, since the beginning that you are working here at Qatar. Because, not only for monetray reasons, but if your company will shoulder the expenses, they will help you in acquiring the family visa.
