RE: Can anyone suggest a good driving school??? Hi there.  I have tried before 2 Driving Schools and have experienced Karwa (in my opinion) the best driving School here in Qatar so far. Their Trainors are all professional and with good attitudes.  You can try calling their hotlines at 4588888 and ask for the driving School.
