RE: Vaccination for swine flu The chances that the Swine Flu virus spreads in Qatar are pretty low.  That doesn't mean that you can be careless.  There is not a vaccination to that particular flu yet, according to what I've read in the news (and I'm quite into reading news about swine flu, since I'm from Mexico and have all my family and friends there) is that the vaccination for Swine Flu will be ready from 4 to 6 months time.  Just take care, try to keep you and your baby away from people who had been in affected areas in the last 3 weeks and that should do it. Don't panic!
