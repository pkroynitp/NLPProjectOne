Family Visa Hi Dear,  Wishing you Happy New Year 2012.  Yes you have been allotted with Visa but its still undergoing few formalities like Final Signature from Signing Authority and Security Clearance. You should go to immigration department and show them the application receipt. They will let you know the exact status. Once everything is done...the status will be changed to "Ready for Printing" and later you can get it printed either from MOI website or get the printed copy from Immigration Dept. Hope this answers your question. All The Best.
