It's expensive.. Yes. It's an expensive one... But we didn't like their taste... We found Majlis much better... Yeah but if you want to enjoy Lebanese village kind of atmosphere, it's worth it...  How much is it expensive? It depends upon your order and servings.. U may get QR 1000 bill for 7 persons...
