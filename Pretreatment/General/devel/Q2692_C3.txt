RE: mail forwarding (amermex?) The company is called Aramex. Their Doha branch is near Salwa road. You can register for their ship and shop services, where they will provide you with a US and UK address. You can use those addresses for your online shopping, and your goods will be automatically routed to Doha for your collection. Here is the link http://www.aramex.com/offices/default.aspx
