RE: where could i buy cute puppies?? All puppies are cute - go to QAWS and if you meet the requirements you will most likely find a companion to love you for life.  However, if you don't meet the requirements - reexamine carefully your desire to get a dog.  They are not a toy, they can live up to 15/16 years of age and they require good care.
