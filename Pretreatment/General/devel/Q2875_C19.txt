I remember a time when we I remember a time when we don't have a safety box yet back home, I forgot where I put the passports and it was the day before our flight back to Doha, I was so worried and dead sweating when suddenly my baby opened his school bag and took our passports out (my baby took it from the cabinet and put in his bag). Whew! What a relief!
