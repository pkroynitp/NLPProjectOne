RE: JUDO Dottymum, Sorry for the late reply. I teach judo at a school, and no, your child is too small for my club because five years old is the bare minimum to start judo; otherwise, the judo club becomes a day care. I would start with the Qatari Judo Federation. They seem to be pretty good with the kids. I haven't worked out with the adult players, because they are always training elsewhere. But the few times I've gone to visit them, there were kids working out. Tunisians are the instructors, and if your game to learn (or already know) French, I would enroll them in their program. They seem very qualified. It's an Arabic/French class at one of the local sports clubs around the Dafna area. Let me know, and I can try to get you contacted with the right people.
