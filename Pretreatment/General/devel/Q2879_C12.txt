Majlis or Khayal I would suggest   Majlis opposite to Marks n Spencer (Land Mark) and Al Sadd   Khayal: Giant Store's Food Court... Well, it's menu is not that big one but I always found its taste way better than any luxury restaurant... Especially Hummus and Shawarma... There is another Khayal or TV R/A.. Don't go to that one.
