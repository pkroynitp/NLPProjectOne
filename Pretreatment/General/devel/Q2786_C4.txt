Thanks for the comments. I am Thanks for the comments. I am hoping that someone can give me some advice how and where to claim this item back. This is the first time we ever ship through land freight. We always used air cargo in the past and our CDs went through just fine. They questioned us, but never confiscate. The guy who we dealt with never informed us verbally nor in in writing about restrictions. The drivers didn't care whether our things were confiscated. Anyway, it's not that important to blame anyone. I just want to get my CDs back.  Most of our boxes were torn apart. We lost all of our medicines even children vitamins and other things. However, we didn't mind as these can be replaced. Our lifetime photos cannot unfortunately.
