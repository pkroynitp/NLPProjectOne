Astrogirl, no apologies please.... ... I would be hurt if I was you.  I have been given the most strangest things when I left work in Abu Dhabi, before coming here. I have kept them, shipped them here to Qatar AND they are a mismatch on my shelves. But you know what? They make this place unique and special, because each thing brings back a memory of a special time AND person. I would NEVER gift something that has been given to me as I do not have the guts or morals to do that. But we are not all the same - and trying to make money of an unwanted gift is sad and shows what the person who it was gifted to is really like.   "Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind"
