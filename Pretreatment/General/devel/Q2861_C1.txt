RE: resign? 1- Nothing in the Qatari law forces the current employer to give you a N.O.C. - release you - or transfer your visa to another employer, it depends on your current employer mode.  2- you should continue one year - 365 - of work for the current employer in order to be eligible for visa transfer even if he permits you to transfer your visa.
