RE: where can i leave my persian cat in summer for not... The average kennel cost is 35 -45QR per day. However, you need to book in December to get a place. Doha Vets have just opened a new facility, call them on 4367187, they may be able to help you, the price will be less if you can find someone who is prepared to share the cage with their cat (if and only if they get along well). Also check with QAWS, they may have space but you really will be very lucky to pay less than the going rate, competition for cages is strong at this time of year.  There is a lady who will visit your house daily, change the litter and feed but it is very sad to leave a lone cat for a month, if you consider doing this why not offer a home to one of QAWS many cats looking for a home? Then, you can leave the cat knowing he will be happy and also giving a home to a cat who really needs it. jj
