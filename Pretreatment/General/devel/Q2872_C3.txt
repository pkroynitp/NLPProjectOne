RE: Switzerland visa If you take a schengen visa from any other country, you are obligated to enter the schengen area through that country or should spend atleast one day more in that country.  You could take a schengen visa through the italian embassy right here in Doha and fly to Milan. You can then take a 3 hour train to Geneva.
