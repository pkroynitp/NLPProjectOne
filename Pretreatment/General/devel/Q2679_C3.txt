RE: where can i leave my persian cat in summer for not... Sorry - QAWS don't do boarding! We're a rescue shelter only.   If you're looking for someone responsible and knowledgeable to care for your pet whilst you are away you will need to spend more then that.  2 months boarding in any of the catteries here in Qatar would be a minimum of QR2,400. And it would probably cost more to have someone come to your house twice a day to care for him.
