So the distance of lightning by yourself is 12 / 3 = 4 km (approximately )    When the flash light, at that time we also see it immediately, because the speed of light is very high, 299,792,458 meters per second. There's almost no delay to reach our eyes.   But, the speed of sound "only" 331 meters per second. As a result, some time after the lightning lit, the new voice boomed.   Therefore, the distance of lightning with thunder listeners about a mile every three seconds. Thunder is rarely heard at a distance of more than 25 kilometers.  <img src="http://u.kaskus.us/3/mfibgiyr.gif" width=250 height=150 />  Good Article... by Aikon
