RE: When you first arrive to Qatar does company put you... Thank you all, so I will just bring King sheets for now.  Is it fairly accessible to get a variety of linen over there?  The higher thread counts?  Or warmer sheets for the cooler nights?  Also blankets? I was told to bring a blanket, could I obtain that over there?
