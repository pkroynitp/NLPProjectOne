For Next year... Finals: For Next year... <b>Finals: Lakers VS Magic</b>  Watch out for these "Dark Horse" Teams Next Season: 1. <b>Clippers</b> (Healthy Davis, Camby, Randolph, Griffin, Kaman expect Kaman/Camby to be traded for a perimeter defender) 2. <b>Heat</b> (healthy wade, o'neal, improving chalmers, they need to make a trade to get a legitimate center, so that O'neal will play PF... Kaman is a good addition) 3. <b>Sixers</b> (run and gun type team plus healthy Elton Brand, plus the good addition of new coach Eddie Jordan)
