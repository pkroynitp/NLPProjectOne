RE: "Home centre" or "Homes r US" ? I think they both are having the same quality ... mostly Chinese or Veitnamees ... it depnd on the materials .. if it is solid wood or rubber wood then it is diffirent from MDF and so on ...  now u have a chance to buy from Home cemter because they have special offer ... buy 250 and get 50 .   according to ur budget u will be able to move .  I personally prefer home center which I furnished my house here and back home from it .   they have more branches and more options to chose .   good luck
