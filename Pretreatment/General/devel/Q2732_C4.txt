RE: can wife sponser husband if he loses job yes you can sponsor ur husband and kids.  you need to first change to your company visa before he loses his job, so that you will save time in this. for this you just need his NOC and your company's willingness to accept you.  then you have to prepare all necessary documents to do the sponsorship transfer of your kids and then husband.
