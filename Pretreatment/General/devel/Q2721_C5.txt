what do you mean when you ask that if "you change sponsorship you still have to pay car loan?"  A loan is a loan no matter what and it has to be repaid in full. Now if it's a company loan for car then for sure they'll take it from your end of service payment (or as much as they can).   If it's a bank loan then notify the bank immediately that you have been terminated and let them know you are actively searching for a new job in order to be able to repay the debt.  Best of luck!!
