RE: Switzerland visa You can approach the German Embassy for a Schengen Visa, that would permit you to visit any of the schengen states (Switzerland, Austria and Czech Republic are schengen states)  You can get the visa application from the office of the German Embassy located in the Al Fardan Building - 3rd floor in Al Sadd (opposite to peadiatrics hospital)  Along with the visa application, you will also be given info on documents required for the visa which is self explanatory.  Trust this assists
