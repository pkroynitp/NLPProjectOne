RE: Notarization of Documents from Philippines? i believe what you need is the authentication of your documents.  The documents you needed to be authenticated should have the red ribbon from DFA Manila. if not then the embassy here will ask you to send it to DFA Manila first before they will authenticate it.  You can do it at the Philippine embassy and then after you go to Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
