Nooo pleeease ...  not HSBC! Nooo pleeease ...  not HSBC! Customer service is horrendous. If everything's hunky dory, you'll be fine but the minute there's trouble, don't hold your breath. My beard would have grown several miles long before they even get moving.   Quick transfer of funds, did you say? Is 3 days quicker than other banks? As for the extensive network thingy - I can't link with my HSBC back home. Still have to go through the convoluted US - MY route. Still 3 days delay.   /Don't have time yet but when I get back to Doha, I'm gonna look into changing banks.   //By the way, HSBC still owes me the cash that didn't get dispensed from the ATM machine a few weeks ago despite being deducted from my account!!! @#!!  ***************************************** Don't want no drama, No, no drama, no, no, no, no drama
