I am starting in January I am starting in January yeah.  Have you gone through Academics?  My interview was in December and according to the agency, the school is waiting on a visa before sending me airline tickets.  Again, rather vague!  I'm sure we'll become well acquainted in the not too distant future.  Are you travelling alone or are you bringing children with you?  I'm coming from the UK (liverpool) by the way...
