Working for Al Maha Academy Hello   I too am to start work for the Ta'allum group at Al Maha Academy.  I did receive my contract and a little after that my airline ticket.  I had to contact the agency that placed me to find out who would be meeting me at the airport.  As far as to where I would be living, they only told me that they have 3 compounds.  Very vauge.  Are you starting in January?  Regards,  Lea989
