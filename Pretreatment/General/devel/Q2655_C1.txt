Sorry! I'm not acquainted with German work environment, but the whole thing looks like a joke to me.  You are a civil engineer who dedicated at least 5 post-graduate years (not working in parallel) with no point or project behind your Ph.D. thesis other than getting the certificate!!!!!! And still you think that European degrees are better than Egyptian for instance.
