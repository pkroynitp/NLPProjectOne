Its always the best practice Its always the best practice to hand it over at the Hotel Reception while you check-in & get it back on Check-out ! Carrying passport along is even more risky that leaving it in a safe locker in your room!   I got my Laptop bag stolen in Barcelona this time & had much of my important docs in it, luckily my passports were in the Hotel Reception.. !   Ofcourse, once you loose passport, its a nightmare!
