RE: can somebody tell me,, how can i bring my family in... Thank you for your reply,, but my visa is only bachelor. If im going to go there first, will I be able to bring them in 3 months time at my own expense? My employer told me that they will help me out about that once I get there, but my question is, what will my first move in qatar? and what are the requiremnts so that before I leave the philippines we can fix all the papers. Thank you very much.
