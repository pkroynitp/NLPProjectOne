RE: When you first arrive to Qatar does company put you... If your housing is not ready, you may be taken to a hotel or a serviced apartment, or guest house/ accommodations. These will be fully furnished.  If its a two bedroom apartment, it's not necessary that the second room will have a medium size bed, it may have 2 single beds, and that can be 90x180 or 120x180 cm.  Don't get the sheets for the guest bedroom yet. You may get one king size bed sheet for the master bedroom.
