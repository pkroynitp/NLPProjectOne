RE: where could i buy cute puppies?? pet shop Sure, go ahead to the pet shop at Al Nasr street.  buy a cute puppy.  Just be informed that ALL pet shops in Doha are very unhygenic and have low (if any) standards.  The animals are usually diseased and sick.   My neighbor bought a kitten for christmas at this very shop.  It died the next day.  She had to threaten them with a call to the police in order to get a refund.   QAWS is your best bet as they have trained vets to help them look over the animals in their care.  Go there and get educated about pet ownership.
