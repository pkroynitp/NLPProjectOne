As per new law:  - Workers are given 90 days to renew their residence permit (RP) after its expiry.   - QR6,000 is the fine for a worker not leaving the country within 90 days after the expiry of his work visa. QR3,600 is the maximum fine for not applying for the residence permit of a newborn within 60 days of its birth or arrival in the country. Per day fine for the violation is QR10.
