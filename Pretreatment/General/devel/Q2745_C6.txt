RE: what is a good 4wd with 6/7 seats? for a hundred thousand you could get an Xterra...amazing off roader with 4L engine and 250 bhp at your disposal...but it is a 5 seater...6 seaters start at 126000...the Prado 2.7L...I am not sure of the american and korean brands though...but I think the Ford Edge is pretty cool...so is the GMC Acadia...
