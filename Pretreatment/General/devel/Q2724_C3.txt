RE: "Home centre" or "Homes r US" ? Both are the same standard. Decent Quality and decent prices (on sale).  Try out this new furniture shop in this new mall come up adjacent to la cigale hotel - al saad.This mall has benetton, BHS etc. On the first level is this furniture shop - it had great looking furniture (The one, id design standard but with home center prices). I have already furnished my place but this is one recommended buy. Doesn't have too much of choice though but since it is a one off shop there are high chances of you do end up having the same furniture as your neighbour (which is a high probabiliy with home center/homes r us)
