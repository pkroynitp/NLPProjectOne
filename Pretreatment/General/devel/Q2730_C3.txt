RE: Driving through when green signal is blinking, will... Traffic rules 101 - Red means to STOP ...  So, If you've crossed the lights while anything but red, you are good.  Some people are extra cautious and stop when the green starts to blink (that is just a personal choice) because the fines are just too hefty. But they risk getting rammed from the behind if they brake suddenly.  You can pass through even on amber, but it is just not worth taking that risk.  Best is to always reduce speed while approaching the lights.
