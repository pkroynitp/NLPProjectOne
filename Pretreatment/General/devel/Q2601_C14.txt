The camp at NDIA is not too The camp at NDIA is not too bad. Cabins are only a few years old and there are plenty facilities.  Transport will be the yellow bus between camp and site - about 15 minutes driving max. Taxis tend not to call there so getting out on your own can be a hassle unless you get pally with a kabayan with a pickup truck at his disposal!  If the salary is same as you get in Dubai you should be able to save more here.
