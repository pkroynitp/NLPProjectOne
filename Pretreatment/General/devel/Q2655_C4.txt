contrary responses Thank you all, I got contrary responses, some say 30,000-40,000 QR others say PhD is like BSc and "German PhD means nothing in the world anymore". Could more members of this forum verify one of these statements? by the way, does working in scientific research  count as work experience? I mean I spent 5 years in laboratory doing experiments for my research, can I say I have laboratory experience now?
