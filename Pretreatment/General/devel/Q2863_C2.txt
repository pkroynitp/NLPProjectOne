RE: Anybody knows where's the Umm Salal passport office?? Markhiya roundabout ---> Passport roundabout ---> Go straight on the highway.   Get on the second interchange and drive to the service road on the left.  (In effect you are taking a U turn, but dont enter the highway, take the service road). The MOI office can be seen at the right.  (I have a small doubt if its the third interchange. Will get back. The general info is correct.)
