RE: Recommend Good Accident Repair Workshop ? Worst garage in Qatar... Al Shoof Garage, Ind Area St- 25  I had a problem (Overheating the engine) with my 2006 model Nissam Altima and unfortunately I gave them to repair.. First they took 10 days to do the work and charged me Qr- 1200/- for labour and Qr- 800/- for parts... But after 2 days I have started facing the same problem and I returned the car to them... They have worked on my car 18 days, removing and installing head & engine.. bought spare parts again... Finally I have taken back my car with the same problems..I am hopeless with these peaple..They never answer my call even if I call 25 times a day...Mr. Sasi is the main mechanic and he is really a rascol...He doesnt know how to deal with customers...  I have to find another garage to repair my car...  But please everyone who read this, do not go to Al Shoof Garage anymore...u will have really bad time ahead...   Shihab.. 55413072
