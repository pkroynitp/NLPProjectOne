RE: When you retake a driving test...? yes u only have to do road test, no need to repeat from start. second thing they failed u sometimes just becoz they r allowed to pass specific quota. they cant pass evryone. they ordered to pass specific number of people. and second everybody is writing that pay some thing to instructor. no need to pay anything to instructor. simply pay 1500 riyal and get rid of test. thats it
