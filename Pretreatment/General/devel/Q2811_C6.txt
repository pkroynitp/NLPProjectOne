Well the offer of employment Well the offer of employment included information on sallary and allowances as well as the extras offered and info on what I am required to provide in terms of documentation.  I know how much I will be paid, the dates covered by my contract and all of that, I am just waiting for specifics on accommodation etc... I know there are other people moving out at the same time so was hoping at least one of them might use this website and might have received some of that information.  I know that I should not expect things in Qatar to be as efficient or transparent as in the UK but I have experience of working in other countries where that is also the case so like I said, I am giving the school the benefit of the doubt...
