The tampon shortage is long The tampon shortage is long gone lol. I would advise bringing medicines thought, even though they are available here under different names I feel more comfy with my trusted brands (placebo effect I guess). If you use any specific hair care products I bring mine from home as many salon and drug store brands are not available here (Paul Mitchell, Goldwell, Joico, Aussi).   Many UK food items are here in Shoprite and Mega Mart, and if they dont have it you can ask them and they will sometimes bring it in.
