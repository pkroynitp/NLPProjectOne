RE: Where can I get my Computer Hard Disk Recover?(acer... As an experienced professional computer user you probably have a complete backup of your data on an external USB hard drive. Maybe you even made a disk image of the c drive or an ASR disk. So, you can throw the defect harddisk away and enjoy your wise planning. If not, well, then you deserve exactly what you got.
