Thank you for the info, I Thank you for the info, I took a friend to  Dr. Kudsia Begum two weeks ago. They don't take apointments and the waiting was very long. During the two hours waiting I had to use the bathroom, and the bathroom was smell so bad, I don't think the bathroom ever gets cleaned. Though my friend says that the Dr. was very good and the examanation room was OK, I still could not think of my self going back there.  Is the Dr. at Women's Hospital taking appointments?
