RE: can wife sponser husband if he loses job Yes you can sponsor your kid and husband provided you meet the necessary criteria of FAMILY VISA set by qatar government...Your salary should be sufficient enough (as far as i know, it's been increased to QR 10000)to have your kid and husband on your visa.  Kindly ask your company PRO for the detail procedure...
