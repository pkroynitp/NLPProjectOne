RE: Me eligible for Dubai On Arrival Visa?? The profession you mentioned is not listed so it will be better to check with the Airlines first. They will not let you board if the profession is not eligible to get the visa on arrival.   There is no credit card payment at Dubai Airport. You should buy one e-card from the bank counter for the visa charges and that is the only one the Immigration will accept and the bank will accept any valid currencies according their exchange rates.
