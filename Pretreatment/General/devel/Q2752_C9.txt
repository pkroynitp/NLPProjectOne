my fellow QL'ers,a my fellow QL'ers,a comparison can only be made between a REAL duty free & a mall,QDF is an excuse,"real" airports have duty free shops so in keeping with that,they've thrown together the basic booze,chocolates,cigarettes,which if you walk fast enough past the security check or blink hard,you'll miss altegether,so really if we are to compare,do it between say dubai or Abu Dhabi or Bahrain duty free & the prices in the hypermarkets/malls...
