the conference finals won't the conference finals won't be an easy journey for cleveland, afterall they will have to play Orlano after they defeated the celtics in game 7 at Boston! and with a 19 point deficit! Again, first time in history Boston would lose a game 7 playoff game!!!  Sorry I meant first time the lose a HOME game 7 in the playoffs RESPECT
