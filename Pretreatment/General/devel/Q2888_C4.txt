RE: Where to buy LAMPE BERGER oil in Doha? You may ask to their distributing agent in the Middle Est :  MIDDLE EAST - Eric Sturma Cration A.M.P. Ltd. Tel: (+971) 4 332 90 19 Ext. 226 e.sturma@creation-me.com  (contact found on Lampe Berger site : http://en.lampeberger.fr/world-of-lampe-berger/lampe-berger-more-than-a-century-of-innovation )  In the meanwhile why don't you make your own oil with lamp oil (good quality one for no smoke/no smell) + essential oil that you like from L'Occitane for example)?  Otherwise "Point a la ligne" (2nd floor Royal Plaza) may have some ready made oil for lamps. You can check with them 4326536.
