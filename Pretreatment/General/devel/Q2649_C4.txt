RE: JUDO Good Day!  Finally I found a Judo Club that started accordingly more than a year ago. The Dojo is under umbrella of the KARATE ACADEMY in Al Sadd Area near to Jarir Book Store and Doha Clinic Hospital.  The Timing of the practice is SUN-TUES-THURS at 18:30-19:45 under Coach Saeed who is a former Qatar Olympic player for 12yrs.  If you are interested you can contact these nos: 4421142 or 5220806.  Enjoy the art of Judo.   Good Luck.
