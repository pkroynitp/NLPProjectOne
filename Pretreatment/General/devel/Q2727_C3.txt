RE: Visa for Mother - in - law Hi Dear,   There is no need of Salary Certificate or Bank Statement or Computer Card. I just called my Mother in Law Last Month. You should have only :  1. Your Mother in Laws Passport Copy. 2. Your Passport copy & ID copy. 3. Your Wife Passport Copy & ID Copy. 4. NOC Letter from your Sponsor.  Please Keep the originals also. Thats it. Good Luck & Go for it.
