hiii Dear nomerci, my answer is till same, why i invite them?? because i ahve this opportunity to, and why i wouldn't invite those like others mention is, if i would invite them i would have a reason to learn something from them, to ask certain questions from them or what else it could be, but if u see all those i wanted to invite have given all there knowledge through books, so why would i invite them? i dont find a reason for inviting them, am not a big fan of personalities rather prefer the work they have done.....i hope u understand my point but i know u never satisfied by any of my replies n thats the thing i like about you :-)
