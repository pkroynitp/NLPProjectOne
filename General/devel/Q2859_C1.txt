RE: When you first arrive to Qatar does company put you... if your company will provide you housing, usually, if the housing is not yet ready for occupancy, they will get a hotel accomodation for you and your family. if it's ready, then you'll be going to your house straight from the airport. like me, the housing was ready so the company driver delivered me staright there, unlike my colleague he was stayed at the hotel until the housing's ready.
