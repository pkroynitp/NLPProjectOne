RE: Certificate Attestation in Doha. You need to get a letter from your employer or a utility bill. Then take to your embassy and ask exactly how you do it. For British, we have to send the certicates to a registered solicitor in the uk who stamps them, sends to uk Ministry of Foreign Affairs, then onto Qatar Embassy in London who stamps them. Once back they can be presented to CEID.
