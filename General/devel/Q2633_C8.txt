RE: Good Bank HSBC are shocking!  their customer service is horrendous, and when you travel abroad they block your credit card, even when you advise their card services department which country you are going to and which hotel you are staying in! also, if you call their customer services from abroad outside of office hours, it goes through to their UAE call centre, who say they cannot help until the Qatar office opens again!  useless, absolutley useless.
