what to bring Hi, i am not australian, but i have seen Marmite at QMart in The Mall. Not seen Vegemite and my aussie friends say you cannot find here. You can find Colemans mustard at MegaMart. You cannot get Red Wine vinegar or anything with the word "wine" in it! I do not "grocery shop" i forage, as you cannot find everything you need in one place.  But you can find pretty much all you need, it will cost you though! I just moved her from London, and before that Japan, and i though it was expensive there!  It was NOTHING compared to here...bring lots of cash if you want to eat like you do at home!There is a Marks and Spencer in Landmark mall that has nice food once in a while, bisquits and crisps and the like. Family Food on Al Merqab seems to have expat things usually, as well. If you can get a visit here before you move that would be helpful as well! Good luck, and be prepared for lots of changes in your life....
