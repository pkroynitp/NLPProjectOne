Post Offices. http://www.qpost.com.qa/ for all details of postal service.  Also the PO just inside door of Lulu D-Ring Road is handy and helpful. In my experience mail to Europe, UK, USA, Bangladesh is  reliable but sometimes a little slow.  Ordinary letters to UK, USA, Europe, do not need registration but for some other countries it might be advisable to avoid problems at the delivery end.
