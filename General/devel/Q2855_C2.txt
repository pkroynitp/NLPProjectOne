RE: HSBC  loan interest . I am surprised that you are so INNOCENT The banks here increase the interest even befor it can be really approved , but when the central bank already decleared reduction of interest  officialy , these banks still wait and kill time till they implement as they want to SQUIZE the customers. The rule of the gane is simple: HEADS I WIN  & TAILS  YOU LOOSE and all this is called fair practice-hahahahahaha GOD BLESS
