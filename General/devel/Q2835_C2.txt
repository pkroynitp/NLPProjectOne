RE: How can I live in DOHA for long time? Live in qatar without family is ok as long as you can see them (back home)every 3 months. You can saving more money eventhough you have to buy air fare 4 times a year. You will happy live with family if company provide family accomodation, educational asisstant for your kids and health insurance for whole family, otherwise you are in big headache.
