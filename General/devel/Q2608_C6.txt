RE: Arabic Teacher salamualaykum sister, I know there is one Syrian lady in my compound that i havent met. she gives a private lesson but i dont know whether she can go to your place. finding a private arabic need an extra effort.  however u can try to look for ladies classes available, they teach tajweed and quranic arabic. I myself is still looking for it as i cannot find morning class (full) while some classes are in the evening. please send me private message whenever you need help.
