RE: Doha fridge magnets.. oops...didn't catch the last line in your post.  The duty free shop used to carry them but maybe not anymore.  Now I feel useless...I am not 100% sure but I believe seeing magnets at the Giant Store in Hyatt Plaza.  It is on the second floor in the far left corner pass the toys where this man there sells lots of different souvenirs.  I hope this help...:)
