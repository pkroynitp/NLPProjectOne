have alook at the new barbie doll collection. What can I possibly say about the Fetish Barbie scheduled to spank  uh, hit  store shelves this autumn? Only that its about time. And I have to have one. Theres a whole cadre of people who have never liked the anatomically impossible dolls squeaky-clean image; some of us even suspected there was a kinky woman inside. Now shes becoming the straight mans/lesbian version of Toms of Finland; the one-time ideal of feminine perfection is all but wielding a whip. Oh right. She already did that dressed as Catwoman Barbie .   http://inventorspot.com/articles/barbie_15545
