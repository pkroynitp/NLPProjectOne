RE: which is the best hospital for baby vaccinations? My baby just completed 6months and i m over with her vaccination..Her next due will be after 1yr..I delivered her in DOHA CLINIC..so i prefer that..Its ok..U can visit HMC also coz i have heard most of the vaccinations r getting supplied from there itself..
