RE: Where can I get my Computer Hard Disk Recover?(acer... here is easy way you could try yourself but only if confident, you could buy a 35 or 24 riyal harddisk case, which basically let you remove your harddisk from laptop connect to case which has a USB connection and than let hardisk connect to another laptop or computer like external harddisk and let you extract your data.  i had problem where when i did above it used to crash to new computer it used to crash immeidatly new computer upon connection, one data recovery ppl told me no way to recover, forunatly i found a cd which helped me recovered on my own, hope it works, if you require more help PM me
