tatess... I would just do what you suggested!!! ... but then I am bold and say what I think, which is more than can be said about many people around us. BUT I sure would confront the person. Maybe you can enlighten us as to what the unwanted gift is so we can bid for it too and embarass the person who has hurt you? (insert big grin here!)
