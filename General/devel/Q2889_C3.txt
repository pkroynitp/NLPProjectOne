Kefir Search - To No Avail... Hi Alpha & Amoud,  I went to ask around in almost all the shops near the "Camel Market" but all of them did not even know what Kefir is... Sigh!   I thought Kefir originated from this region but it's disappointing to find most people have not even heard of it. Guess I'll have to give up searching...  Regards, NKL
