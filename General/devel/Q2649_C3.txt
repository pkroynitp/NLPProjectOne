RE: JUDO Thanks for re-opening this question. NO! There is no private JUDO clubs except the federations without proper motivations for their players.  The closes thing that I saw is the one near to Frinje Naseer area. It is Jujitsu Club. As you know Jujitsu is the first cousin of JUDO.  I think I will enroll there, cause I am become rusty as days passby.  They are open in the evening.
