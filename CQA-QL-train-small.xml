		<CBody>Dear, All!
Please read question before you are writing answer! i wasn`t asking where I can do massage!!!
I asked about oil!

As for second answer - I`m searching oil for body massage. Bought one in Canterpoint, there is a small shop near sports shop, and that oil has nice smell, but! It`s not for making massage to anyone! </CBody>

		<CBody>You might be able to find Body Massage Oil in Body Shop at Landmark or City Centre, and if they do have it there, its guaranteed to be good for massage, as some places sell duplicates, so watch out as this could cause allergies to the skin. Good Luck !</CBody>
